Camera Simulator is a web application that allows you to simulate different camera settings and see their impact on an image. You can choose different lenses, adjust ISO, aperture, and shutter speed, and observe how these settings affect the final image.

## Usage

1. Visit the [Camera Simulator](https://dyhhhz26.github.io/camera-simulator) web page.
2. Use the lens selector to choose a lens.
3. Select the camera mode (Automatic or Manual).
4. Adjust ISO, aperture (f/), and shutter speed sliders based on your preferences.
5. Observe how the image changes in real-time according to your settings.

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to dynamically update the image based on your camera settings. It simulates the impact of ISO, aperture, and shutter speed on the image's brightness.
